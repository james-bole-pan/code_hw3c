# Evolutionary Algorithms: Evolving Soft Robots

## Repository Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on evolving soft robots with variable morphologies using evolutionary algorithms. The primary objective is to use these algorithms to evolve a robot design that moves as fast as possible.

## Visual Representation
Below is an image showcasing the evolution of robot morphology in this project:
